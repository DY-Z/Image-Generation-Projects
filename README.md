# Image Generation with Deep Learning
This repo contains three personal projects completed during my free time.\

## Image Colorization with GAN
In this project, I aimed to colorize images with a DCGAN. I used a U-Net with self-attention as the generator.

## Generating Rembrandt-style paintings
In this project, I tried to generate Rembrandt-style paintings with CycleGAN [1].

## Continuous Normalizing Flow with Flow Matching
This is a demonstration on how to generate images through continuous normalizing flow. It is also an implementation of [2] and [3].
